# MultiVersion-Unfinished
POCKETMINE MultiVersion Structure

- MultiVersion is an experimental PocketMine-MP 5 plugin intended to provide compatibility between multiple Minecraft Bedrock versions using protocol-based palettes (blocks, items, biomes, and entities).

- This plugin does NOT work on its own in its current state.
It is published only as a structural base / starting point for developers who want to continue its development.

- At the moment, the plugin does not intercept network packets, does not translate runtime IDs, and does not provide real multi-version support.
- It is not usable in production.

- This repository defines the architecture, data organization per protocol, and the general idea of a MultiVersion system, but requires significant additional development to become functional.

- Use this project for educational purposes or as a foundation for a complete MultiVersion implementation.
